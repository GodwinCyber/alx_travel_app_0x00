# Django Restful framework travel project

## Overview
- This task guides learners through creating essential backend components in Django by defining database models, setting up serializers for API data representation, and implementing a management command to seed the database. By working on the duplicated alx_travel_app_0x00 project, learners will gain practical experience in structuring relational data, serializing it for API endpoints, and programmatically populating the database with sample data to simulate real-world application scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

- __Model relational data__ in Django using appropriate fields, relationships, and constraints.
- __Create serializers__ to transform Django model instances into JSON for API responses.
- __Implement a management command__ to automate database seeding.
- __Test and validate__ database population using Django’s command-line tools.


## Learning Outcomes
Learners will be able to:

- Define models such as Listing, Booking, and Review with correct relationships (e.g., ForeignKey, OneToMany).
- Use Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers to prepare model data for APIs.
- Write and execute a seeding script to insert realistic sample data into the database.
- Apply database seeding to streamline development and testing workflows.


## Key Concepts
- __Django Models__ – Mapping Python classes to database tables.
- __Relationships__ – Implementing one-to-many and many-to-one associations between models.
- __Constraints__ – Ensuring data integrity with validation rules.
- __Serializers__ – Converting complex data types into JSON for APIs using DRF.
- __Management Commands__ – Extending Django’s CLI to perform custom tasks.
- __Database Seeding__ – Populating databases with sample or default data.

## Tools & Libraries
- __Django__ – Backend framework for building the application.
- __Django REST Framework (DRF)__ – For creating API serializers and endpoints.
- __SQLite/PostgreSQL__ – Database engines for storing data.
- __Python__ – Programming language for backend logic and scripts.

## Real-World Use Case
In a travel booking platform, developers need to design data structures for listings (properties available for booking), customer bookings, and user reviews. Serializers ensure this data can be delivered via APIs to mobile or web clients. During development, seeding the database with sample listings allows frontend developers and testers to work with realistic data without manually creating entries, significantly speeding up the development lifecycle and ensuring consistent test scenarios.
